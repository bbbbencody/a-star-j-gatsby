heading: Your best projects you want to highlight
description: >-

  We can also skip this section since it's similar to what's on the landing page, or remove the landing page section instead.

    Right now this isn't very sophisticated, it's just a list of a fixed number of photos. If you want this to be something
    more of a true gallery you can scroll/search through and upload any number of pictures to, that might take a little extra work.

      Very helpful through all stages of the design process as well as construction itself. Kept insisting on bushes at the base
      of my walkway. Couldn't tell you why.
